# DDC
This project is a web application built with Django that uses machine learning to predict insulin dosage for patients with diabetes. The model for insulin-dependent patients was generated using the Bergman minimal model in Matlab, simulating the exercise as a disturbance that occurs in the morning before breakfast, and the meals were a disturbance that occurred three times a day.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Python 3.x
Django 3.x
Pip
Virtualenv (optional, but recommended)
Matlab (if you want to re-train the model)
